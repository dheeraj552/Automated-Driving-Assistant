# Automated-Driving-Assistant
The aim of this project is to develop a convenient and safety system that reduces driver burden on highways and motorways by controlling the vehicle's steering, acceleration, deceleration and other functions to maintain the speed.
This system uses deep learning models like CNN and other image based neural networks to detect vehicles present in all four sides of it. Then the system takes decision to move the user’s vehicle with respect to the detected vehicle. This system that I am going to develop is only suitable in highways with less traffic. As the system is trained for only few cases of arrangement of vehicles. This system also uses sensors to detect the distance between the user’s vehicle and the detected vehicle and also include that as a parameter for taking decisions. This system needs slight supervision of the user, as completely automatic system is dangerous.
